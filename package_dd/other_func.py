    Hello, my friend, welcome to the dragon and dungeon game!
    I am '-HELP'
    My duty is to be by your side everywhere in the game if you need help
    For this purpose, we have prepared a guide for you so that
    you don't have any problems in the process of running the game
    So stay with me...
    You need a username and password to enter the game
    If you have, enter "-login" in the input field, otherwise,
    enter "-register" and create an account for yourself.
    And if you want to leave the game for any reason,
    use the '-exit' command and you can even go back to the previous page with '-return'
    Even the '-hint' command is built in to help you
    Wherever you are in the program and you see the '>>>  ' icon,
    you can enter the desired command in it.
    After these steps, you will enter the game level setting section
    There are easy, medium and hard respectively
    For each of these levels you have to pay a coin from the wallet in your command
    And winning in each of those coin levels will be awarded to you
    By default, anyone who creates an command for
    the first time will be given 50 coins as a gift
    Now, if you don't have enough coins to run the game,
    you can get coins by watching sponsors' ads with the '-adv' command
    Don't forget to log out after entering your account
    Now we get to the start of the game
    You must use the four directions up, down, left, right to move
    the game character and you must try to reach the dungeon and escape from the dragons.
    I hope you can escape from the dragon :))
    Good luck
